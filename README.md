Simbl is a code for simulating atmospheric plasma (streamers) via particle approach. It includes N2 and O2 excitation processes as well as photoionization.

This code was developed as part of my Bachelor's thesis on Masaryk University. The thesis is available online at https://is.muni.cz/auth/th/bho46/?lang=en
